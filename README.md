# secure-password-generator
Hi there! Thanks for checking out this repo.

I built this project because I honestly got tired of trying to come up with passwords i keep getting forgetting them or keep getting hacked so i created this too genrate a random password and save it for me , so i don't forget it 

# What does it do?
It’s a command-line tool that generates strong, randomized passwords for you. But unlike basic generators, I wanted to give the user full control.
With this code user can decide what they want in their password (like !,@,#, 1,2,3 etc) , it can also save password so user dont have to remember it

You can tell it:
* How long you want the password to be. 
* Whether to mix in numbers (0-9).
* Whether to sprinkle in special characters (!@#$).
* it asks if you want to save the password to a text file so you don't forget it immediately.

## How to run it
If you have Python installed, you can run this in seconds.

1.  Clone this repo or just download the file.
2.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
3.  Run the script:
